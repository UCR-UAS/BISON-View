Header:
	The file shall have a header including a breif description of the file;
		Everything else is more or less stored in git.  And blame shall be
		applied thusly.

Function Statements and Braces:
	At the beginning of each function statement, the brace for the function
		shall appear at the line proceeding the function statement.

Other Statements and Braces:
	At the beginning of each if, while, for, etc. there shall be a brace
		after the statement.

		example:

		for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
			std::cout << "I can count: " << i << std::endl;
		}

	It should be noted that "else" can have surrounding braces.

		example:
		
		if (debug_level => 1) {
			std::cout << "Changed Variable: " << changed << std::endl;
		} else {
			std::cout << "Variable changed" << std::endl;
		}

Pointers:
	Dereference and reference are always right-aligned.

		example:

		int *i = &temporary;

Indentation and Tabs:
	Tabs are done through four (4) spaces.

	Most of the indentation is actually handled by QtCreator very well.
		So no concerns if your indentation does not match completely.
